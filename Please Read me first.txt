Hello Dr. Eslam ....
- The idea of ​​the project in general is on the About us page.
- The data of the participants in the project is on the Contact us page.
- HTML and CSS were generally relied on, javaScript was not used very much in this project because there is no actual need for it except in a few of the topics in which it was used.
- Please browse all pages of the site carefully because it has been worked hard to obtain this result within a period of only one week, with an average of 10,000 lines of code.
- Now you can browse the site at your convenience , thank you very much ;)
